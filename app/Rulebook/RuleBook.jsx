              Motion is a specific action made by delegates to direct debate in
              a certain direction. Motions are proposals made to direct
              discussions and decisions. They structure debates, set agendas,
              and control speaking time. By guiding conversations, they ensure
              order and efficiency, helping groups make informed choices in
              organized settings.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are several types of motions commonly used in MUN:
              <br />
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>1. Motion to Open Debate:</b>
                  <br />
                  At the beginning of the committee session, the first motion
                  made is typically to open the debate on the agenda topics.
                  This motion is usually passed unanimously or without much
                  opposition, and it signals the start of discussions,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>2. Motion to Set the Agenda:</b>
                  <br />
                  After the debate is open, delegates may propose motions to
                  determine the order in which the topics will be discussed.
                  This motion allows delegates to prioritize the most pressing
                  issues or contentious topics first,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>3. Motion for Moderated Caucus:</b>
                  <br />
                  During a moderated caucus, the committee is temporarily
                  adjourned, and the debate is structured with a specific
                  speaking time allotted to each delegate. A motion for a
                  moderated caucus is made to discuss a specific topic or issue
                  in-depth,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>4. Motion for an Unmoderated Caucus:</b>
                  <br />
                  An unmoderated caucus is a less formal session where delegates
                  can move around the room and interact more freely with each
                  other to collaborate, draft resolutions, or form alliances,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>5. Motion to Enter Voting Procedure:</b>
                  <br />
                  When delegates believe that sufficient debate and discussion
                  have taken place, they may propose a motion to enter the
                  voting procedure. This motion requires a specific threshold of
                  support to pass, indicating that the committee is ready to
                  vote on a resolution,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>6. Motion to Close Debate:</b>
                  <br />
                  If the committee feels that they have adequately discussed a
                  topic and are ready to move on or conclude the debate on a
                  specific issue, a motion to close the debate can be made,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>7. Motion to Adjourn the Committee:</b>
                  <br />
                  This motion is made towards the end of the conference when the
                  delegates wish to end the session. It signals the conclusion
                  of the committees work and officially adjourns the session.

              Delegates may find limited time to express their views and
              strategize on agendas. To address this, they can participate in
              concise informal discussions using chits. This also contributes to
              the assessment process. Delegates write crisp chits indicating
              their country name, discussion topics, and recipient country.
              The process follows the given Sequence: <br />
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  1. Delegates write chits, including the sender and receiver
                  country names,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>2. Chits are submitted to the Chair for approval,</li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  3. Approved chits are forwarded by the Chair to the intended
                  delegate,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  4. Delegates engage in unmoderated discussions on indicated
                  topics,
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                  5. Discussions aim to facilitate collaboration, planning, and
                  alliances.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              This approach empowers delegates to enhance engagement, plan
              effectively, and establish connections while ensuring transparency
              and maintaining the Chair oversight. The Source and destination
              countries for each chit are clearly stated to ensure proper

              Yield is when a speaker decides to give up the remaining time in

              specific requests, seek clarification, or address procedural
              matters during the committee session, Points are used to ensure

              A Caucus refers to a specific period of time during a committee
              session when delegates come together in smaller groups to engage
              in more informal and focused discussions on specific agenda topics
              or issues. The purpose of a caucus is to encourage collaboration,
              negotiation, and the drafting of solutions or resolutions. <br />

                  <b>1. Moderated Caucus:</b>
                  <br />
                  <br />A debate format that allows delegates to make short
                  comments on a specific sub-issue. Typically, delegates who are
                  interested in speaking will raise their placards and the
                  Chairs will call on delegates to speak one at a time. In order
                  to move into a moderated caucus, the motion must include the
                  overall speaking time, the time per speaker, and the sub-issue
                  to be discussed. Example: Italy moves for a 5-minute moderated
                  caucus with 30 seconds of speaking time per delegate for the
                  purpose of discussing solutions to women rights.

                  <br />
                  <br />A debate format in which delegates can leave their seats
                  to go and talk to others freely and informally. This is
                  usually when delegates find allies and work on draft
                  resolutions. In order to move into an unmoderated caucus, the
                  motion must include the overall caucus time and preferably the
                  purpose of the unmoderated caucus. It is also called an
                  Informal Caucus.
